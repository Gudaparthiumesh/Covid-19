        <p class="mainText">The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses 
            in humans including common cold and more severe forms like SARS and MERS which 
            are life-threatening. The virus is named after its shape which takes the form of a crown 
            with protrusions around it and hence is known as coronavirus.

        <b>How did the recent outbreak occur?</b>

            The recent outbreak of coronavirus is believed to have occurred in a market for illegal 
            wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Chinese health authorities and the WHO 
            are investigating the outbreak of the recent coronavirus.

        <b>Is the recent strain fatal?</b>
        <p class="mainText">Since it's a new strain, there is no specific vaccine that can treat it. 
            However, according to the WHO, "many of the symptoms can be treated and therefore 
            treatment based on the patientâ€™s clinical condition". 
            However, it has already killed over 169,000 globally.</p>
        <br/>
        <b>What steps have been taken so far to check its spread?</b>
        <p class="mainText">The Chinese govt initially locked down Wuhan - the epicenter of the virus outbreak. 
            However it was too late. The virus has spread to all continents now, except Antarctica.</p>
