            <ol class="slds-list--ordered" style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li> Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
                <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
                <li>Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
                <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li> 
                <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
                <li>Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>

        <b>Take steps to protect others</b>
        <p class="mainText">
            <ol class="slds-list--ordered" style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li>Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick</li>       
                <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>  
                <li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>  
                <li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>  
                <li>If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare providerâ€™s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>  
                <li>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li>  
                <li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.</li>
